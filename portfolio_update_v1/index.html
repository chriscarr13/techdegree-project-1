        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer who is fascinated with how websites such as Google, work.
          As a graduate from UCSD, I have obtained a mixed set of skills in coding, music, visual arts, and science. Furthermore, I also have a diverse working history. Essentially, I love learning and gaining new skills, and this curiosity I have for how things work only fuels my motivation to learn.
        </p>
        <p>I have worked as a Bartender and an Audio-Visual technician and enjoyed every second of it, but due to the Covid-19 epidemic, I unfortunately lost my job, including an employment offer. This new-found freedom has given me a chance to reflect; I realized that I sincerely miss computer science and that it was time move on into a new career. So far I have taken a couple of classes in web development and my excitement to learn more increasess.

        <p>As a UCSD alumnus with a degree in Interdisciplinary Computing and arts major, I would like to push the boundaries of what web development as a tool can do for art and science.
